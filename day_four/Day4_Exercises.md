1. Create a class that represents a bucket

- For example, it can have three attributes:
	
	- name
	
	- max volume
	
	- current volume





2. Add a function that uses the class created in the previous exercise so you can transfer volume from one bucket to another but not exceede the  max volume of a bucket.


3. Create a class that can be used to represent a spaceship. This should include the speed of the spaceship, the distance to its target, and any passengers on board. In addition create a function that advanced the spaceship towards its target and a second function that determines how many times it needs to advance at its speed to reach its target.
