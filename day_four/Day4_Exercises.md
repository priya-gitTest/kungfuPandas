1. Create a class that represents a bucket

- For example, it can have three attributes:
	
	- name
	
	- max volume
	
	- current volume





2. Add a function that uses the class created in the previous exercise so you can transfer volume from one bucket to another but not exceede the  max volume of a bucket.
