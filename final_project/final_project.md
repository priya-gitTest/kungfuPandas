Your final project is to build a Pig Latin translator.

For those of you who do not know the rules for translating an English word to Pig-Latin are as follows:

	• If the word starts with a vowel, it is unchanged.

	• Otherwise, all of the consonants at the beginning of the word (up to the first vowel) are moved to the end of the word, preceded by a dash (for readability), and followed by “ay”.

What I want you to do is using the MVC format build a program that can take in user input and translate it to Pig Latin and from Pig Latin. 

I should be able to select whether I want to go to or from Pig Latin.

Extra:

If you finish early I would like you to add another option to your program. I would like you to take in the name of a file in the same directory with user input and translate that file into Pig Latin and then save it as a new file with the name of the old file translated into Pig Latin.
